# Realistic Parking Mod

Are you tired of your city roads getting gridlocked by traffic looking for (nonexistent) parking?
Tired of cars making erratic u-turns in the middle of your main roads because of a parking reroute?
Tired of parking garages for high-rise buildings barely having any parking spots?

This mod aims to make the parking behavior more realistic and improve traffic efficiency.

## Features
* **Induced Demand for Parking**: With this mod, parking spots will only accept a limited amount of pathfinding requests, so once enough cars start driving towards a spot, it will become closed off to future pathfinding. This makes for a more realistic amount of cars in the city relative to the amount of available parking and keeps cims from parking far from their destination.
* **Reduced Parking Reroute Distance**: In vanilla, cars can detect their parking spot getting taken up to 4000 nodes away, causing them to make erratic and dangerous u-turns when they reroute to a new spot. This mod allows you to reduce that range so that cars will only see if their spot is taken once they are near their target parking spot.
* **Parking Minimums for Garages**: In vanilla, apartments only have 2-3 parking spots in their garages, even if there are hundreds of residents, and high-rise offices also usually only have 30 spots, regardless of the number of employees. This mod alters the parking garage capacity to be dependent on the household and worker count of the property.
* All features can be disabled if wanted

## Adding to an existing save
* This mod can be safely added to an existing save, but it may cause some weird behavior at first. Since the demand system does not affect existing pathfinding requests from before the mod, if you have limited parking in your city, you may see cars flocking to one parking spot before rerouting away. To alleviate this behavior, I recommended that you keep your reroute distance high at first and wait for the these cars to reroute.

## Removing from a save
* This mod can be safely removed from a save, as while some features overwrite vanilla values, they should be reset to their vanilla values on load by the game.

## Compatability
* There are no current known incompatabilities with this mod.

## Notes
* Many building assets do not have a parking garage built in, and this mod does not add them in.
* Parking garage's vehicle count values may appear bugged, as it will rise and fall without cars entering. This is a limitation of the current implementation, as this count is used in pathfinding and representative of the garage's demand + actual count.
